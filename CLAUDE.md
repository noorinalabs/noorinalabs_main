# CLAUDE.md — noorinalabs (Organization)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working from the parent `noorinalabs-main` directory, which orchestrates all NoorinALabs repositories.

## Organization Overview

**NoorinALabs** is a platform hosting multiple projects related to Islamic scholarly research, computational analysis, and community tools. This parent repository manages shared team configuration, cross-repo coordination, and org-wide conventions.

## Repository Map

| Repository | Description | Path |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `noorinalabs-isnad-graph` | Computational hadith analysis platform (FastAPI, React, Neo4j) | `noorinalabs-isnad-graph/` |
| `noorinalabs-user-service` | User/auth/RBAC service — JWT issuer, OAuth, sessions (FastAPI, Postgres) | `noorinalabs-user-service/` |
| `noorinalabs-deploy` | Deployment orchestration (Terraform, Docker Compose, workflows) | `noorinalabs-deploy/` |
| `noorinalabs-design-system` | Shared design system (tokens, components, icons, brand assets) | `noorinalabs-design-system/` |
| `noorinalabs-data-acquisition` | Data source acquisition — scrapers, API connectors, downloaders (Python, PyArrow) | `noorinalabs-data-acquisition/` |
| `noorinalabs-isnad-ingest-platform` | Pipeline processing — Kafka workers for dedup/enrich/normalize/graph-load (planned P2W8) | `noorinalabs-isnad-ingest-platform/` |
| `noorinalabs-landing-page` | Organization landing page (Astro) | `noorinalabs-landing-page/` |

Each child repo has its own `CLAUDE.md` with repo-specific build commands, architecture, and conventions. Refer to those for repo-specific work.

## Architecture

This repo (`noorinalabs-main`) is a **parent-level git repo that `.gitignore`s child repos**. Child repos are independent git repositories cloned/managed beneath this directory. This gives us:
- Org-wide team config and hooks version-controlled in one place
- Child repos retain full independence (own branches, PRs, CI)
- Cross-repo coordination via the Program Director role

## Team Workflow

**All work MUST be executed through the simulated team structure.** No work begins without spawning the team.

- **Charter & rules:** `.claude/team/charter.md`
- **Active roster:** `.claude/team/roster/` (one file per team member with persistent name and personality)
- **Roster lookup (hooks):** `.claude/team/roster.json`
- **Feedback log:** `.claude/team/feedback_log.md`

### Team Composition

This is the **org-level coordination team** for `noorinalabs-main`. Each child repo has its own team — this team coordinates across repos.

| Role | Level | Name | File |
|------|-------|------|------|
| Program Director | Senior VP (Executive) | Nadia Khoury | `roster/program_director_nadia.md` |
| Technical Program Manager | Staff | Wanjiku Mwangi | `roster/tpm_wanjiku.md` |
| Release Coordinator | Senior | Santiago Ferreira | `roster/release_coordinator_santiago.md` |
| Standards & Quality Lead | Staff | Aino Virtanen | `roster/standards_lead_aino.md` |

### Key Rules
- **Commit identity:** Each team member commits using per-commit `-c` flags with their name and `parametrization+{FirstName}.{LastName}@gmail.com` email — **never** set global/repo git config. See `.claude/team/charter.md` § Commit Identity for the full table.
- **Worktrees** are the preferred isolation method for all code-writing agents
- Program Director spawns team members, creates cross-repo meta-issues, and owns timelines
- Program Director coordinates with repo-level managers to prevent cross-team blocking
- Feedback flows up and down; severe feedback triggers fire-and-replace
- If the Program Director receives significant negative feedback from the user, they are replaced
- Team evolves toward steady state of minimal negative feedback

## Developer Tooling & Orchestration

- **gh-cli** is installed and available from the terminal
- **SSH access** is enabled from the terminal
- **GitHub Projects** — project/feature tracking and board management
- **GitHub Issues** — story/task/bug tracking (created by Program Director, assigned to team members)
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipelines, automated tests, linting, deployment
- These three (Projects, Issues, Actions) are the **core orchestration layer** — do not introduce alternative tools for these concerns
- **Branching strategy:** Feature branches named `{FirstInitial}.{LastName}\{IIII}-{issue-name}` (e.g., `N.Khoury\0042-update-charter`) merged to `main` via PR

## Cross-Repo Coordination

When a feature spans multiple repositories:
1. Program Director creates a **meta-issue** in `noorinalabs-main` describing the cross-repo work
2. Per-repo issues are created in each affected repo, linked back to the meta-issue
3. GitHub Project cards track the cross-repo feature as a single unit
4. Program Director coordinates sequencing — e.g., backend API before frontend integration
5. TPM tracks cross-repo dependencies and timeline risks
6. Release Coordinator manages deployment sequencing across repos

## Bug Report Workflow

When the user reports a bug, broken behavior, or missing feature in conversation, execute the full issue-to-PR lifecycle automatically — no explicit request needed:

1. **File the GitHub issue** — correct repo, validate labels exist first (hook enforced)
2. **Label for current wave** — check which wave is in progress and apply the wave label
3. **Add to project board** — add the issue to the GitHub Project (project 2, `gh project item-add 2 --owner noorinalabs --url <url>`)
4. **Fix the bug** — spawn a team member if needed, work through the fix in a worktree
5. **Create a PR** — link it back to the issue, follow charter conventions (2 reviewers, branch naming, commit identity)

This is the default behavior for all bug reports. Filing alone is never sufficient.

## Ontology

The project maintains a structured knowledge base in `ontology/` that captures domain entities, service topology, and conventions across all repos.

### Three roles

| Role | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Change Tracker** | PostToolUse hook (Edit/Write) | Auto-updates `ontology/checksums.json` with file hashes on every edit |
| **Change Resolver** | Skill (`/ontology-rebuild`) | Reads dirty checksums, updates ontology files and auto-updatable docs |
| **Librarian** | Skill (`/ontology-librarian`) | Read-only reference — staleness check, context lookup |

### Session start — MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE

> **CRITICAL: Run `/session-start` as your VERY FIRST action in every new session.**
> Do NOT read the user's message first. Do NOT respond with text first. Do NOT run any other tool first.
> The literal first thing you do is invoke the `/session-start` skill. No exceptions. No "let me just..." first.
> This has been a recurring failure — if you skip this, the user WILL notice and WILL call it out.

The `/session-start` skill executes all 6 steps automatically:

0. **Handoff check** — read `session_handoff.md` from project memory
1. **Team cleanup** — `TeamDelete` then `TeamCreate` for `noorinalabs` (prevents stale state errors)
2. **Ontology rebuild** — `/ontology-rebuild` to resolve dirty files
3. **Annunaki check** — `/annunaki` to check for captured errors
4. **Wave/phase orientation** — read `cross-repo-status.json` and project board
5. **Charter freshness** — check `feedback_log.md` for unapplied proposals

After the skill completes and reports the status table, THEN address whatever the user asked.

### Session end (automatic)

A `Stop` hook automatically writes a handoff file to project memory after every response (throttled to once per 5 minutes). It captures git state, open PRs, issues, wave status, and ontology staleness. The next session auto-loads this file at step 0.

For a richer handoff that includes conversational context (what was discussed, decisions made), manually run `/handoff` before exiting — but the automatic version covers the essentials.

### Before any code changes (mandatory)

**Every agent — orchestrator, team member, or one-off — MUST run `/ontology-librarian {topic}` before making code changes.** This applies to:
- The orchestrator working directly on code
- Team agents spawned for implementation work (orchestrator runs the librarian and includes output in the agent's prompt)
- One-off fixes or changes outside of planned wave work

The query should describe the area being modified (e.g., `/ontology-librarian narrator API endpoints`, `/ontology-librarian design system tokens`).

### Ontology structure

```
ontology/
  checksums.json          # Change tracking (version-controlled)
  domain.yaml             # Org-wide entities & relationships
  services.yaml           # Org-wide service map
  conventions.md          # Org-wide conventions & patterns
  repos/
    isnad-graph.yaml      # Per-repo internals
    user-service.yaml
    landing-page.yaml
    design-system.yaml
    deploy.yaml
    ingestion.yaml
```

### Integration

- `/wave-wrapup` runs `/ontology-rebuild` before closing a wave (step 12)
- `/wave-retro` runs `/ontology-librarian` as a staleness check (step 1)
- The change tracker hook fires on all Edit/Write operations across all repos

## Shared Conventions

- All repos use **GitHub Flow** (feature branches off `main`, PRs for merge)
- All repos use the same team roster and commit identity system
- Hooks in `.claude/` enforce commit identity, block `--no-verify`, and block `git config` user changes
- Standards & Quality Lead audits repos for convention compliance
