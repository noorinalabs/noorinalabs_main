# Automated Enforcement Hooks (Claude Code)

The following charter rules are enforced automatically via Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`. These are PreToolUse hooks that fire before Bash commands. Hook scripts live in `.claude/hooks/`.

## Hook 1: Validate Commit Identity (`validate_commit_identity.py`)

- **What it automates:** Commit Identity rules — validates that every `git commit` command includes `-c user.name=` and `-c user.email=` flags matching a roster member.
- **Parent+child roster merge (#112 part a):** When the target repo (either the repo hosting this hook, or the `cd <path>` target of a cross-repo commit) sits inside another git repo that itself has `.claude/team/roster.json`, the hook loads the parent roster and merges it under the child roster at load time. Child entries win on name collision. Walk-up is limited to ONE level to avoid false positives in nested `code/` trees. This lets org-level coordinators (e.g. Nadia.Khoury, Wanjiku, Santiago, Aino) commit in any child repo without duplicating their entries into every child `roster.json`.
- **Augments:** The [Commit Identity](commits.md) section. The manual rule still applies; this hook enforces it automatically.
- **Manual steps remaining:** When a new team member is hired, add their name and email to the appropriate `.claude/team/roster.json` — org-level coordinators go in `noorinalabs-main`'s roster, per-repo members go in that repo's roster.
- **Emergency override:** Remove or comment out the hook entry in `.claude/settings.json`. Re-add after the emergency.

## Hook 2: Block `--no-verify` (`block_no_verify.py`)

- **What it automates:** Prevents team members from using `--no-verify` on git commit, which bypasses pre-commit hooks.
- **Augments:** General code quality and CI enforcement rules. Pre-commit hooks are a required gate.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook is fully automated.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`. The user can also run git commands directly outside Claude Code.

## Hook 3: Block `git config` (`block_git_config.py`)

- **What it automates:** Commit Identity rules — blocks `git config` write commands to prevent modification of global/repo-level git config. Read-only operations (`--get`, `--list`, `-l`, etc.) are allowed for tooling compatibility.
- **Augments:** The charter rule "do NOT modify the global or repo-level git config."
- **Manual steps remaining:** None.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 4: Auto-set `ENVIRONMENT=test` (`auto_set_env_test.py`)

- **What it automates:** Ensures `ENVIRONMENT=test` is set before any `pytest`, `uv run pytest`, or `make test` command. Prevents CI breaks caused by missing environment variable.
- **Augments:** Testing workflow. This is an automated safeguard, not replacing a prior manual rule.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook blocks and instructs the user to prepend `ENVIRONMENT=test`.
- **Skip conditions (#114):** Two short-circuits run before the pytest/make-test regex to prevent substring false-positives in GitHub API calls and body content:
  1. **`gh` subcommands** — if the effective argv[0] (after stripping leading `VAR=value` assignments) is `gh`, the hook skips. `gh` is a GitHub API client, never a test runner.
  2. **`--body` / `--body-file` flags** — if the command contains either flag, the hook skips. Structured bodies almost always contain user-supplied text mentioning `pytest` or `make test`. This skip is intentionally broad — a rare false negative on an exotic `--body`-using tool is cheaper than blocking every review/issue/comment that references pytest.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 5: Validate Labels Before `gh issue create` (`validate_labels.py`)

- **What it automates:** GitHub Label Hygiene — validates that all `--label` values exist in the repository before `gh issue create` runs.
- **Augments:** The label hygiene section. The manual rule to run `gh label list` first is now enforced automatically.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook fetches labels and validates automatically.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`. If `gh label list` is unavailable (network issue), the hook allows the command with a warning.

## Hook 6: Validate Lockfile Paths (`validate_lockfile_paths.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `git commit` if any staged `package-lock.json` contains `/tmp/` or `file:/` paths — local worktree artifacts that break CI.
- **Augments:** CI reliability. Session 4 had a Playwright PR with `/tmp/noorinalabs-design-system-0.0.1.tgz` baked into the lockfile.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook scans staged lockfiles automatically.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 7: Validate PR Review (`validate_pr_review.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh pr merge` unless the PR has at least one review from a non-author. Enforces the charter's peer review requirement.
- **Augments:** [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) review requirements. Session 4 saw all PR reviews skipped across 3 waves.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook queries `gh pr view` for reviews automatically. Use `--admin` flag for emergency overrides.
- **Emergency override:** Pass `--admin` to `gh pr merge`, or remove the hook entry.

## Hook 8: Block `gh pr review` (`block_gh_pr_review.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh pr review` commands (--approve, --request-changes, etc.) since all agents share one GitHub user and API-based reviews always fail with "cannot approve your own pull request".
- **Augments:** [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) § Comment-Based Reviews. Redirects agents to use `gh pr comment` with the charter review format (Requestor/Requestee/RequestOrReplied fields).
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook blocks and provides the correct format.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 9: Validate Branch Freshness (`validate_branch_freshness.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh pr create` if the feature branch is behind the base branch. Prevents merge conflicts from stale branches. Honors the `--repo OWNER/REPO` flag (#118 fix): when present, the freshness check uses the GitHub `compare` API against the target repo instead of the cwd-based `git fetch`/`git merge-base`. Without `--repo`, falls back to cwd behavior. Cross-repo PRs without `--head` are skipped (we cannot infer head reliably from cwd).
- **Augments:** [Branching](branching.md) workflow. Session 4 had RBAC and session hardening PRs conflict because neither was rebased.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook runs `git fetch` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` (cwd path) or `gh api repos/.../compare/{base}...{head}` (cross-repo path) automatically.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 10: Validate VPS_HOST (`validate_vps_host.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh variable set VPS_HOST` if the value resolves to a Cloudflare IP range. Also warns if a hostname is used instead of a direct IP.
- **Augments:** Deployment safety. Session 4 had VPS_HOST set to a Cloudflare-proxied domain, causing SSH timeout on deploy.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook resolves the hostname and checks against known Cloudflare ranges.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 11: Warn GHCR Image (`warn_ghcr_image.py`)

- **What it automates:** Warns (does not block) when `gh workflow run` triggers a deploy-related workflow and the expected GHCR image may not exist.
- **Augments:** Deployment safety. Session 4 had deploy-all triggered before the landing page GHCR image was built.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook checks `gh api` for the image. This is a warning only since deploy workflows sometimes build the image.
- **Emergency override:** Not needed (warning only). Remove the hook entry to suppress.

## Hook 12: Validate Wave Context (`validate_wave_context.py`)

- **What it automates:** Warns when agents are spawned without an active wave context in `cross-repo-status.json`. Ensures `/wave-kickoff` is run before agent work begins.
- **Augments:** [Agent Lifecycle](agents.md) wave management. Session 4 had the orchestrator bypass the team structure entirely.
- **Matcher:** `Agent` (not `Bash`) — fires on Agent tool calls.
- **Manual steps remaining:** Run `/wave-kickoff` to set the wave context. The hook is a warning, not a block.
- **Emergency override:** Not needed (warning only). Remove the hook entry to suppress.

## Bash Hook Dispatcher Architecture <!-- promotion-target: none -->
All Bash-matcher hooks are consolidated into a **single dispatcher** (`bash_dispatcher.py`) that dynamically loads individual hook modules via `importlib.util`. This reduces process spawns from N (one per hook) to 1 per Bash tool call.

**Key design decisions:**
- Individual hook files remain as standalone modules — testable independently, loaded dynamically by the dispatcher
- `bash_dispatcher.py` is the **only** Bash-matcher entry in `.claude/settings.json`
- Hook execution order is preserved (matches the order hooks are registered in the dispatcher)
- **Fail-open:** If an individual hook crashes, the dispatcher logs a warning and continues — it does not block the command
- **Short-circuit on block:** If any hook returns a blocking result, subsequent hooks are skipped
- `sys.exit` calls from individual hooks are intercepted via mock to prevent the dispatcher from terminating

**Adding a new Bash hook:**
1. Create the hook script in `.claude/hooks/` as a standalone Python module
2. Register it in `bash_dispatcher.py`'s hook list
3. Do NOT add a separate entry in `.claude/settings.json` — the dispatcher handles all Bash hooks

**Why:** Phase 2 Wave 1 PR #73 consolidated 12 individual Bash-matcher hooks into this pattern, reducing process spawns from 12 to 1 per Bash call.

## Dispatcher Consolidation Policy <!-- promotion-target: none -->
When hooks sharing the same matcher type (Bash, Agent, SendMessage, etc.) accumulate beyond **3**, they must be consolidated into a dispatcher immediately. Do not wait for hook sprawl to become a performance problem.

**Threshold:** >3 hooks of the same matcher type triggers mandatory consolidation.

**Pattern to follow:** The Bash hook dispatcher (`bash_dispatcher.py`) is the reference implementation. Key properties any new dispatcher must preserve:
- Dynamic module loading via `importlib.util` — individual hooks remain standalone and independently testable
- Single entry in `.claude/settings.json` per matcher type — the dispatcher is the only registered hook
- Fail-open on individual hook crashes — log a warning, continue to the next hook
- Short-circuit on block — if any hook returns a blocking result, skip subsequent hooks
- Intercept `sys.exit` calls from individual hooks to prevent dispatcher termination

**When to apply:**
- Before adding a 4th hook of the same matcher type, consolidate the existing hooks into a dispatcher first
- When reviewing PRs that add new hooks, verify the hook count and flag if consolidation is needed
- This applies to all matcher types: Bash, Agent, SendMessage, PreToolUse, PostToolUse

**Why:** Phase 2 Wave 1 accumulated 12 Bash-matcher hooks before consolidation (PR #73). Each hook spawned a separate Python process per Bash call — 12 process spawns for every command. Consolidation reduced this to 1. Apply the pattern proactively to avoid repeating this accumulation.

## Hook 13: Auto-Add Issues to Project Board (`auto_add_issue_to_board.py`)

- **What it automates:** After `gh issue create` runs, detects the new issue URL in stdout and runs `gh project item-add` to add it to the Cross-Repo Wave Plan board (project #2).
- **Type:** PostToolUse (advisory, non-blocking).
- **Augments:** Cross-Repo Wave Plan § Board Maintenance Rules — "New issues created during a wave must be added to the board immediately."
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — fully automated.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the hook entry from `.claude/settings.json`.

## Hook 14: Validate PR CI Status (`validate_pr_ci_status.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh pr merge` when any CI check on the PR is failing, cancelled, timed out, or requires action. Pending checks also block unless the user passes `--auto` (let GitHub auto-merge on green). Queries `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`; supports the `--repo` flag.
- **Augments:** [Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) "green CI before merge" requirement. Phase 2 Wave 7 merged multiple PRs with red `security-audit`, `e2e`, and `test_migrate_users.py` checks despite the charter rule. Per the enforcement-hierarchy principle (hook > skill > charter), a repeatedly violated charter rule becomes a hook.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook queries `gh pr view` for the check rollup automatically.
- **Emergency override:** Pass `--admin` to `gh pr merge`, or remove the `validate_pr_ci_status` entry from the dispatcher hook list.
- **P2W9 retro findings (2026-04-22):** Hook 14 is registered in noorinalabs-main but is NOT synced to child repos. `gh pr merge` on child-repo PRs (deploy#146 in particular) bypassed the CI check because the dispatcher in the child repo doesn't list this hook. **Action:** sync Hook 14 to all 7 child-repo dispatchers following the same pattern as #112 part (b) for `validate_commit_identity`. Additionally, the hook's behavior on **pending** checks may have been too permissive during P2W9 — the mid-CI-run merge window allowed main#178 to merge before FAILURE conclusions materialized. Tighten the pending-check semantics to block mid-run merges unless `--auto` is passed to hand off to GitHub's auto-merge. Tracking issues: noorinalabs-main#182 (main), noorinalabs-deploy#148 (cross-repo sync).

## Hook 15: Enforce Librarian Consulted (`enforce_librarian_consulted.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit` tool calls unless `/ontology-librarian` has been consulted earlier in the session. Reads the session transcript (`transcript_path` from the Claude Code hook input) and scans for either a user slash-command invocation of `/ontology-librarian` or an assistant `Skill` tool_use with `skill: "ontology-librarian"`. As of [#169](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/169) the hook also accepts a cwd-keyed sentinel file at `<cwd>/.claude/.librarian-consulted/<sha1(cwd)>.marker` written by the librarian skill, with a 1-hour TTL. Either signal (transcript OR fresh sentinel) is sufficient; the sentinel fallback fixes a transcript-flush race that blocked worktree subagents from editing despite having invoked the librarian. Known limitation: a subagent sharing its parent's cwd (non-worktree, rare) would be covered by the parent's sentinel — worktree subagents, the dominant case, each have distinct cwds and distinct sentinels. If neither signal is present, the edit is blocked with instructions to run the librarian first.
- **Augments:** [CLAUDE.md § Ontology — "Before any code changes (mandatory)"](../../../CLAUDE.md). The charter rule "Every agent — orchestrator, team member, or one-off — MUST run `/ontology-librarian {topic}` before making code changes" was honored inconsistently across Phase 2 Wave 9 (3 of 4 code-change PRs skipped it — deploy#125 kafka GID, deploy#130 obs fix, user-service#67 OAuth GET). Per the enforcement-hierarchy principle (hook > skill > charter), a repeatedly violated charter rule becomes a hook. See issue [#150](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/150).
- **Matcher:** `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit` (not `Bash`) — direct registration in `settings.json` since these are the first PreToolUse hooks on these matchers. When a 4th hook is added to any of these matchers, consolidate via the dispatcher pattern (see § Dispatcher Consolidation Policy).
- **Allowed bypasses:** `/tmp/**` (out-of-repo scratch), `~/.claude/**` (user config), `**/memory/*.md` and `MEMORY.md` (project memory), `.claude/annunaki/*` (hook-managed log). All other paths — including `.claude/team/feedback_log.md`, charter files, and source code — require librarian consultation. Stance documented in the hook docstring: meta-files are project-state artifacts the ontology tracks; treating them as free-edits replays the decay pattern #150 fixes.
- **Manual steps remaining:** Run `/ontology-librarian {topic}` once per session before any Edit/Write/NotebookEdit on non-allow-listed paths. One invocation unlocks the session.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the three `enforce_librarian_consulted.py` entries (Edit/Write/NotebookEdit matchers) from `.claude/settings.json`. Re-add after the emergency. There is no in-band override flag — the purpose of the hook is to break the "this one's small" rationalization, so an inline bypass would defeat the point.
- **Promotion provenance:** First end-to-end execution of the memory → charter → hook promotion pattern ratified by the owner on 2026-04-19. Rule lived in CLAUDE.md § Ontology (charter-equivalent location) since W7; this hook is the underlying enforcement layer. Worked example referenced by the future `/promotion-audit` skill design.

## Hook 16: Refuse Worktree Self-Delete (`no_worktree_self_delete.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `git worktree remove <path>` when the caller's current directory (`input_data["cwd"]`, the shell's actual `$PWD` at tool-call time) equals `<path>` or is a descendant of it. Resolves both sides via `os.path.realpath` so symlinks do not defeat the check. Splits chained commands on `&&`, `||`, `;`, and `|` so `cd /safe && git worktree remove <cwd>` still blocks — the `cd` is a plan the shell has not yet executed when the hook fires. Strips leading `FOO=bar` env-var assignments and skips global `git -C <dir>` / `-c k=v` options plus `remove`-level flags (`-f`, `--force`) during parse so the `<path>` argument is extracted reliably. Prefix-confusion is avoided via `Path.relative_to` semantics rather than string `startswith`, so `/foo/wt-a-sibling` is not treated as descending from `/foo/wt-a`. The block message names a safe cwd to move to (best-guess via `git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree` / `--show-toplevel` run with the parent of the target worktree as cwd; generic fallback if those fail).
- **Augments:** Worktree hygiene. Wave-8 retro item 5 noted: "Worktree-self-delete is a real operator risk... Guard: prefix with explicit `cd <project-root>` to a known-existing path, or detect cwd ancestry before removing." The guard was noted but not implemented; the same footgun fired again and forced a session restart during cleanup. Per the enforcement-hierarchy principle (hook > skill > charter), a caller-side convention that decayed becomes a hook. See issue [#173](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/173).
- **Matcher:** `Bash` via the dispatcher (`no_worktree_self_delete` entry in `dispatcher.py`'s `_BASH_HOOKS` list). Cheap filesystem-only check, ordered near the top of the list.
- **Manual steps remaining:** None — the hook fires automatically on every Bash call that contains a `git worktree remove` segment. Skills that remove worktrees (`/wave-wrapup`, cleanup flows) should still follow the safe-cd pattern (defense in depth) — the hook is the backstop, not the only line of defense.
- **Emergency override:** Remove the `no_worktree_self_delete` entry from `dispatcher.py`'s `_BASH_HOOKS` list. Re-add after the emergency. There is no in-band override flag — the purpose of the hook is to prevent a specific operator footgun, so an inline bypass would defeat the point.

## Hook 17: Validate Wave Audit (`validate_wave_audit.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks PreToolUse `Skill` calls for `wave-wrapup`, `wave-retro`, and `handoff` when the active wave has open items in any org repo AND the skill's `args` payload does not contain an explicit carry-forward marker. Reads the active wave label from `cross-repo-status.json` (`current_wave` + `phase` → e.g. `p2-wave-10`), runs `gh issue list --repo noorinalabs/<repo> --state open --label <label> --json number --jq length` across the 8 org repos (charter `skills.md` § Audit command), sums the result, and gates accordingly. Carry-forward markers recognized: `Carry-forward:` or `Carry forward:` inline (case-insensitive), `## Carry-forward` markdown heading, or `#<N> → <destination>` arrow patterns naming a non-numeric destination. All infrastructure failures (missing `gh`, network errors, malformed `cross-repo-status.json`, missing wave label) fail OPEN with a system warning so a transient infra hiccup never blocks legitimate work — the hook only blocks when it is *certain* the wave has open items the author hasn't acknowledged.
- **Augments:** [`charter/skills.md`](skills.md) § Wave Lifecycle — Open-Item Audit. The charter rule is the source of truth for *what* counts as a valid carry-forward acknowledgment; this hook is the enforcement layer. Promotion provenance: memory `feedback_honest_audit_over_conclusion_claim` (2026-04-22) → charter `skills.md` § Wave Lifecycle (PR #193) → this hook (issue [#195](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/195)). Second worked example of the memory→charter→hook promotion pipeline ratified 2026-04-19 (Hook 15 was the first).
- **Matcher:** `Skill` (new matcher type — first hook of this kind in the codebase). Direct registration in `settings.json` per dispatcher consolidation policy (§ Dispatcher Consolidation Policy: consolidate at 4+ hooks of the same matcher; this is the only Skill-matcher hook).
- **Manual steps remaining:** None when the gate fires — the operator must either close the open items, OR add a carry-forward block to the skill `args`. The charter rule still mandates the same discipline for manually-authored handoffs and retros that don't go through skills (those are out of scope for the hook; a separate Stop-hook scan was considered and deferred per the design comment on #195).
- **Emergency override:** Remove the `Skill` matcher entry from `.claude/settings.json`. There is no in-band override flag — the purpose of the hook is to break the "this one's fine, just say concluded" rationalization that put the P2W9 incident on owner's desk. Matches Hook 15's stance.

## Hook 19: Validate Workflow Paths Coverage (`validate_workflow_paths_coverage.py`)

- **What it automates:** Blocks `gh pr create` / `gh pr ready` when the PR diff modifies any `.github/workflows/*.yml` file that is NOT covered by any base-branch workflow's `on.pull_request.paths:` filter (or by a base workflow with `on.pull_request:` and no `paths:` filter). Closes the **workflow-file orphan** failure class — a PR can land workflow changes that GitHub silently skips CI on, producing `statusCheckRollup: []` + `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` (which `validate_pr_ci_status` only blocks on FAILED, not EMPTY). Companion to Hook 9 / `validate_pr_ci_status` at the trigger-graph layer.
- **Coverage logic:** Builds the union of `on.pull_request.paths:` patterns across all base-branch workflows; tracks whether ANY base workflow has `on.pull_request:` without a `paths:` filter (covers everything). For each `.github/workflows/**` file in the PR diff, checks against the union. Path matching uses `fnmatch` with `**` glob expansion. Workflows with `paths-ignore:` only (no `paths:`) are conservatively treated as no-paths-filter coverage (over-allows slightly; safer side for the orphan-blocking goal).
- **Augments:** Charter `pull-requests.md § CI Workflow `pull_request` Triggers Must Cover Wave Branches` (sibling at the wave-branch coverage layer; this hook covers the workflow-file-orphan layer). Both rules together close the trigger-gap class surfaced in P2W10 via deploy#153 + user-service#80/#81.
- **Matcher:** `Bash` via `dispatcher.py` (`_BASH_HOOKS` list, ordered after `validate_branch_freshness` since both are PR-create gates and this one fetches base-branch workflow YAMLs — the network calls land late in the chain).
- **Manual steps remaining:** When the hook blocks, the PR author has three remediation paths (named in the block message): (a) precursor PR adds `'.github/workflows/**'` to a base workflow's paths filter — recommended; (b) add a workflow with `on.pull_request:` and no `paths:` filter (covers everything including future workflow files); (c) `--admin` at merge time if the change genuinely needs no CI (rare).
- **Emergency override:** Remove the `validate_workflow_paths_coverage` entry from `dispatcher.py`'s `_BASH_HOOKS` list. There is no in-band override flag — the purpose of the hook is to prevent silent CI skipping, so an inline bypass would defeat the point.
- **Out of scope for v1:** Net-zero infra-revert orphan detection (`statusCheckRollup: []` + non-base HEAD) — requires re-running GitHub's paths-filter evaluator at hook time. Filed as follow-up. Cross-repo reusable-workflow inheritance (`workflow_call`/`uses:`) — reviewer responsibility.
- **Promotion provenance:** P2W10 retro-candidate (2026-04-24, deploy#153 76d7d7f orphan). Filed as [#203](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/203) sibling of [#200](https://github.com/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-main/issues/200) — different layer of the same trigger-gap class. Promoted to hook in P3W4 T5.

## Hook Authorship Requirements <!-- promotion-target: none -->
Every new hook in `.claude/hooks/` must meet these requirements **at the time it is merged**. Partial compliance is a moderate feedback event.

### 1. Input-language specification

The hook's module docstring (top of file) must include an explicit **Input Language** section defining:

- **Fires on:** which PreToolUse event (Bash, Agent, Edit, Write, etc.)
- **Matches:** the exact command / input shape the hook acts on, expressed as a regex or grammar fragment
- **Does NOT match:** inputs that superficially look similar but are intentionally out of scope (with examples)
- **Flag pass-through:** which CLI flags (e.g., `--repo`, `--admin`) are extracted from the matched command and how

Example (from `validate_pr_ci_status.py`):
```python
"""
Input Language:
  Fires on:      PreToolUse Bash
  Matches:       gh pr merge {N} [--repo {OWNER/REPO}] [--squash|--merge|--rebase] [--admin] [--auto]
  Does NOT match: gh pr list, gh pr view, gh pr checks, gh pr create, git merge, git pull
  Flag pass-through:
    --repo   → overrides cwd-resolved repo when querying gh pr view
    --admin  → short-circuits (emergency override, allows merge)
    --auto   → allows pending checks (GitHub auto-merge)
"""
```

**Why:** Phase 2 Wave 8 surfaced six hook substring/regex bugs (#113 validate_labels cwd, #114 auto_set_env_test test-string false-positives, #118 validate_branch_freshness cwd, #123 validate_pr_review RequestOrReplied-Requested false-positive, ontology-tracker /tmp ghost entries, validate_labels default-limit). Root cause was hooks written liberally without an explicit spec of what they match vs. don't. An input-language docstring forces the author to enumerate the negative space before shipping.

### 2. Charter entry in `charter/hooks.md`

Every new hook must have a numbered entry in this file with: What it automates, Augments (which charter section), Manual steps remaining, Emergency override. No hook ships without a charter entry.

### 3. Test coverage for negative matches

The hook's test suite (or docstring-embedded manual verification) must include at least one input that **looks like a match but is intentionally excluded** — to guard against the substring-bug pattern. Example: a `validate_pr_merge` hook must verify it does NOT fire on `gh pr list`.

### 4. Dispatcher registration (not settings.json)

New Bash hooks must register in `dispatcher.py`'s `_BASH_HOOKS` list, not as a separate `settings.json` entry. See `charter/hooks.md` § Hook Dispatcher Consolidation (Hook 7 pattern).

**Enforcement:** The Standards & Quality Lead (Aino) verifies these requirements during hook PR review. A hook missing any of the four requirements must not be approved.
