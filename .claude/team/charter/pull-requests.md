# Pull Requests

When all work on a feature branch is complete (code committed, review done, must-fixes resolved), the submitting team member **automatically creates a PR to the deployments branch** for their wave using the `gh` CLI. Do not wait for manual instruction.

**PR ownership:** Only the team member who implemented the work creates the PR. The Program Director must NOT create duplicate PRs for the same branch.

## Comment-Based Reviews (Mandatory)

All agents share a single GitHub user account. **`gh pr review --approve` is blocked** — it always fails with "cannot approve your own pull request". All PR reviews MUST use comment-based reviews instead.

**Review format** (posted via `gh pr comment`):
```
Requestor: <PR author name>
Requestee: <reviewer name>
RequestOrReplied: Approved | Changes Requested
```

The `Requestor` must differ from the branch author (validated by the merge hook). This is enforced by the `block_gh_pr_review.py` PreToolUse hook and validated by `validate_pr_review.py` at merge time.

## PR Review Workflow for Deployments Branch PRs

1. **Create the PR** targeting `deployments/phase{N}/wave-{M}`.
2. **Notify a reviewer** — the PR creator must notify at least one other team member to review the PR. Use SendMessage or a GitHub comment to notify. **A PR MUST NOT be merged without at least one peer review.** For waves with fewer than 4 engineers, the manager's review counts but must include a substantive review comment (not just "LGTM").
3. **Reviewer performs the review** and posts a comment-based review on the PR with:
   - **Must-fix items** — blocks merge; the submitter must resolve before proceeding.
   - **Tech debt items** — does not block merge; tracked as GitHub Issues.
   - The reviewer then **notifies the PR creator** (via SendMessage or mention) that the review is complete and what action is needed.
4. **PR creator acts on review**:
   - **Must-fix items**: Fix immediately and push to the branch.
   - **Quick-fix tech debt**: Fix immediately if minimal impact.
   - **Non-trivial tech debt**: Create a GitHub Issue for future planning.
5. **Push final changes** from the review fixes.
6. **The team merges** the PR into the deployments branch themselves — no user approval needed for PRs into deployments branches.

## Review Finding Disposition

Every finding from a PR review must be dispositioned before merge. No finding may be silently dropped.

| Finding Type | Action Required | Blocks Merge? |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Must-fix** | PR originator fixes on the branch before merge | Yes |
| **Tech-debt** | Reviewer or originator creates a GitHub Issue for each item before merge | No (but issues must exist) |
| **Quick-fix tech-debt** | PR originator fixes immediately if minimal effort | No |

**Enforcement:** The charter enforcer (Aino) verifies during PR review that:
1. All must-fix items are resolved before approving merge
2. All tech-debt items have corresponding GitHub Issues created
3. Issues are labeled `tech-debt` and assigned to the appropriate team member

## Post-Merge Integration Verification

**After every PR merge into a deployments branch**, the manager must verify the integrated result before merging the next PR:

1. **Pull the updated deployments branch** locally (or in a worktree).
2. **Run the repo's full check command** (`make check`, `npm run check`, or equivalent — lint + typecheck + build).
3. **If the check fails:** The last-merged PR introduced a regression. The manager must notify the PR author to fix it before any further PRs are merged.
4. **If the check passes:** The next PR may be merged.

This catches semantic conflicts that GitHub's textual merge cannot detect (e.g., two PRs that individually pass CI but break when combined). Managers must NOT merge multiple PRs in rapid succession without verifying in between.

**CI enforcement:** All repositories must configure CI workflows to trigger on pushes to `deployments/**` branches (not just PRs). This provides automatic verification after each merge, complementing the manager's manual check.

## Cross-PR Dependency Sequencing

When multiple PRs in the same wave have dependencies (e.g., PR B depends on changes from PR A):

1. **Identify dependencies** before merging — check if any PR depends on another PR's changes
2. **Merge in dependency order** — base PR first, dependent PR second
3. **Do NOT merge dependent PRs in parallel** — even if both have green CI, the dependent PR's CI ran against the base branch WITHOUT the dependency
4. **After merging the base PR**, the dependent PR must rebase/merge the updated base before its CI result is trusted
5. **Document dependencies** in PR descriptions: "Depends on PR #N (must merge first)"

## Wave Merge PR Verification

At the **end of a wave or phase**, the Manager creates a PR from the deployments branch into `main`. Before presenting the PR to the user:

1. **Verify all CI checks are green** — run `gh pr checks {NUMBER}` and confirm every job passes.
2. **If any check fails**, fix it before notifying the user. The user should NEVER see a wave merge PR with red CI.
3. **Report CI status** explicitly when presenting the PR: "All N checks passing."
4. **Provide full clickable URLs** when presenting PRs to the user — use `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/pull/{number}`, not `repo#number` format.

The **user reviews and merges** this PR. Do not proceed to the next phase until the user has merged.

## PR Template

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create --base deployments/phase{N}/wave-{M} --title "<short title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing the change>

## Related Issues
Closes #<issue-number>

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Reviewed by another team member
- [ ] Must-fix items resolved
- [ ] Tech debt items filed as GitHub Issues (if any)

Co-Authored-By: Firstname Lastname <parametrization+Firstname.Lastname@gmail.com>
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

)"
```

- PR title should be concise (under 70 characters).
- The body must reference the related GitHub Issue(s) with `Closes #N`.
- The submitting team member is responsible for creating the PR immediately upon branch completion.

## Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing a branch and creating a PR, every engineer must:

1. **Run the repo's lint check** (`ruff check` / `npm run lint` / equivalent) — fix all errors.
2. **Run the repo's format check** (`ruff format --check` / `npx prettier --check` / equivalent) — fix any formatting issues.
3. **Run the repo's typecheck** (`mypy` / `npm run typecheck` / equivalent) — fix type errors.
4. **Run the full test suite** — `npm run test` / `make test` / equivalent. This includes unit tests AND E2E/Playwright if the repo has them. Do NOT skip tests — content changes can break test assertions.
5. **Verify branch name** — `git branch --show-current` must match `{FirstInitial}.{LastName}/{IIII}-{issue-name}`.

Pushing code that fails lint, formatting, or tests is a **minor feedback event**.

## CI Enforcement After PR Creation

After creating a PR, **every team member** must follow this process:

1. **Wait for all CI jobs to complete.** Do not merge or request review until CI has finished.
2. **If all CI jobs pass:** The PR is ready for review. Proceed with the normal review workflow.
3. **If any CI job fails:**
   - Investigate the failure and attempt to fix the root cause.
   - Push the fix to the **same branch** (the PR will update automatically).
   - Alert the project owner (user) with the following information:
     - Which CI job failed
     - Root cause of the failure
     - What was done to fix it
     - Whether project owner assistance is required
4. **If the failure cannot be resolved:** Do **NOT** merge the PR. Notify the project owner immediately and pause all dependent work until the issue is resolved.

Violating this process (e.g., merging with red CI, ignoring failures, or failing to escalate) is treated as a **moderate feedback event** per the Feedback System.
