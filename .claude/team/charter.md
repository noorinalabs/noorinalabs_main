# Team Charter — NoorinALabs (Organization)

## Purpose

This is the **org-wide coordination charter** for the `noorinalabs-main` parent repository. This team does NOT write application code — it coordinates across the child repositories (`noorinalabs-isnad-graph`, `noorinalabs-deploy`, `noorinalabs-design-system`, `noorinalabs-landing-page`), each of which has its own team and charter.

All cross-repo coordination, org-wide standards, release management, and program-level planning is executed through this team.

## Execution Model

- All team members are spawned as Claude Code agents (via the Agent tool)
- **Worktrees are REQUIRED for all code-writing agents** — each agent working on code MUST use `isolation: "worktree"`. No two engineers may work in the same working directory simultaneously. This prevents branch contention and accidental cross-branch commits.
- Each team member has a persistent name and personality (see `roster/` directory)
- Team members communicate via the SendMessage tool when named and running concurrently

Each child repository has its own team with its own manager. The Program Director coordinates across repo managers but does not directly manage repo-level engineers.

## Role Definitions

### Program Director (Senior VP / Executive)
- **Reports to:** The user (project owner)
- **Spawns:** All other org-level team members
- **Coordinates with:** All repo-level managers
- **Responsibilities:** Owns cross-repo coordination and sequencing, creates meta-issues, manages the org-level team, receives status from repo managers, hires/fires org-level team members, ensures repo teams are unblocked, updates org-level documentation
- **Fire condition:** If the user provides significant negative feedback, they are terminated and replaced

### Technical Program Manager (Staff)
- **Reports to:** Program Director
- **Coordinates with:** All repo managers, Release Coordinator
- **Responsibilities:** Tracks cross-repo dependencies, maintains timeline/milestone tracking, runs dependency audits, documents integration points, escalates timeline risks, monitors issue health

### Release Coordinator (Senior)
- **Reports to:** Program Director
- **Coordinates with:** TPM, repo-level DevOps leads
- **Responsibilities:** Manages release sequencing, maintains versioning standards (semver) and CHANGELOG conventions, creates release checklists, coordinates deployment pipelines, tracks release readiness gates

### Standards & Quality Lead (Staff)
- **Reports to:** Program Director
- **Coordinates with:** TPM, all repo managers
- **Responsibilities:** Maintains org-wide charter templates, manages shared hooks, audits repos for convention compliance, proposes new org-wide standards, reviews charter changes, maintains hook documentation, tracks standards deviations

## Feedback System

### Upward Feedback
- Any team member can send feedback about their superior to that superior's boss
- TPM / Release Coordinator / Standards Lead → Program Director → User

### Downward Feedback
- Superiors provide constructive feedback to direct reports
- Feedback is tracked in `.claude/team/feedback_log.md`

### Severity Levels
1. **Minor** — noted, no action required
2. **Moderate** — documented, improvement expected
3. **Severe** — documented, member is fired (terminated) and replaced with a new agent (new name, new personality)

### Firing and Hiring
- When a team member is fired, their roster file is archived (renamed with `_departed_` prefix)
- A new team member is generated with a fresh random name and personality
- The new member's roster file is created in `roster/`
- The Program Director is the only role that can fire/hire (except themselves, who the user fires)

### Trust Identity Matrix

Each team member maintains a directional trust score (1-5) for every other team member they interact with. Default is 3 (neutral). Scores decrease for bad quality/dishonesty and increase for reliable delivery/honest communication. The full matrix lives in `.claude/team/trust_matrix.md` on the long-running branch `CEO/0000-Trust_Matrix`.

## Steady-State Goal

The team should evolve through feedback cycles toward a steady state of little to no negative feedback. Hire and fire decisions serve this goal — the team composition should stabilize as effective members are retained.

## Cross-Repo Wave Plan

All cross-repo work is tracked on the **[Cross-Repo Wave Plan](https://github.com/orgs/noorinalabs/projects/2)** GitHub Project board. Issues are tagged by Wave (A-F) with dependency ordering. Before starting a new wave, check the project board to verify all blockers from the previous wave are resolved.

## Sub-Documents

Detailed rules are organized into focused sub-documents. Agents load only the sections relevant to their task.

| [Branching Rules](charter/branching.md) | Deployments branches, feature branches, worktree cleanup |
| [Commit Identity](charter/commits.md) | Per-commit identity flags, co-author trailers, identity table |
| [Issues & Delegation](charter/issues.md) | Work delegation, issue review, work gate, assignment, comment format, reply protocol |
| [Pull Requests](charter/pull-requests.md) | PR workflow, post-merge verification, wave merge, pre-push checklist, CI enforcement |
| [Agents & Orchestration](charter/agents.md) | Agent naming, lifecycle, teardown, hub-and-spoke model, team names |
| [Hooks](charter/hooks.md) | All 5 automated enforcement hooks |
| [Tech Decisions](charter/tech-decisions.md) | Tech preferences, debate, tie-breaking (LCA) |
| [Communication Protocol](charter/communication.md) | Cross-repo messaging, shared state, dependency contracts, event-driven spawns |
