Automate the wave kickoff process for the `{team_name}` team.

> Note: all repo paths in bash blocks below are rooted at `$REPO_ROOT` to avoid cwd drift when the skill is invoked from a worktree or child-repo subdirectory (#149).

## Instructions

### 0a. Verify next-wave scope is reconciled (Mandatory precondition — added P3W5 #273)

`cross-repo-status.json` MUST carry a `wave_{M}_scope_reconciled_at` ISO timestamp written by `/wave-scope {P} {M}`, and that timestamp MUST post-date the previous wave's retro completion timestamp. If absent or stale, STOP and require the user to run `/wave-scope {P} {M}` first.

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
SCOPE_TS=$(jq -r '.wave_{M}_scope_reconciled_at // empty' "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json")
PRIOR_RETRO_TS=$(jq -r '.wave_$(({M} - 1))_retro_completed_at // .wave_$(({M} - 1))_completed_at // empty' "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json")

if [ -z "$SCOPE_TS" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: wave_{M}_scope_reconciled_at missing in cross-repo-status.json."
  echo "  Run /wave-scope {P} {M} before /wave-kickoff."
  exit 1
fi

if [ -n "$PRIOR_RETRO_TS" ] && [ "$SCOPE_TS" \< "$PRIOR_RETRO_TS" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: wave_{M}_scope_reconciled_at ($SCOPE_TS) predates last retro ($PRIOR_RETRO_TS)."
  echo "  Re-run /wave-scope {P} {M} so the reconciliation reflects the current carry-forward + memory-must-include state."
  exit 1
fi

echo "  Scope reconciled at: $SCOPE_TS (post-dates last retro: $PRIOR_RETRO_TS)"
```

This check is a deterministic JSON read — no GitHub API calls, no side effects. It catches the off-path case where `/wave-kickoff` is invoked without a recent `/wave-scope` (drift signal: meta-issue out of sync with labels). The common path is covered by `/wave-retro` Step 9, which auto-invokes `/wave-scope {P} {M+1}` at end-of-wave.

### 0. Derive wave repos in scope (Mandatory first step)

The canonical source for the wave's repo list is `cross-repo-status.json` key `wave_{M}_repos_in_scope` (array of `noorinalabs-*` strings). All subsequent steps iterate this list.

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE=$(jq -r ".wave_{M}_repos_in_scope[]" "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json")
test -n "$WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE" || { echo "ERROR: wave_{M}_repos_in_scope missing or empty in cross-repo-status.json"; exit 1; }
echo "Wave repos in scope:"
printf '  - %s\n' $WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE
```

If the key is missing, STOP — the wave is not properly scoped. Add `wave_{M}_repos_in_scope` to `cross-repo-status.json` before invoking the skill.

For path resolution: each repo `R` lives at `$REPO_ROOT/$R` EXCEPT `noorinalabs-main`, which IS `$REPO_ROOT`. Use this helper:

```bash
repo_path() {
  local r="$1"
  if [ "$r" = "noorinalabs-main" ]; then echo "$REPO_ROOT"; else echo "$REPO_ROOT/$r"; fi
}
```

### 0.5. Pre-flight checklist (Mandatory — Pattern F mitigation)

Before any branch creation, label work, or agent spawning, complete this checklist for every repo in the wave's planned scope. The Phase 3 Wave 3 retro identified **6 orchestrator-class pre-flight gaps** (wave-branch creation, attribution, child-repo-implementer rule ×2, 2-reviewer planning, naming, spawn order) — all caught by downstream layers, not pre-flight. This step closes Pattern F.

For each repo `R` in `$WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE`:

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | **Wave branch exists in repo `R`** | `gh api repos/noorinalabs/$R/git/refs/heads/deployments/phase-{N}/wave-{M}` returns 200 (not 404). Step 1 is responsible for creation; this check confirms it landed before subsequent steps run. |
| 0.2 | **Implementer roster confirmed for `R`** | Per child-repo-implementer rule (memory `feedback_child_repo_implementer_rule.md`): implementers come from `R`'s own team roster, not the orchestrator's parent team |
| 0.3 | **Every scoped issue's `actual_repo_for_changes` is correct** | Re-read every issue body; sibling-of references can mislead. Concrete example: deploy#242 was filed as "sibling-of isnad-graph" but the actual code change was in landing-page (caught by Idris-853 in P3W3 only after kickoff) |
| 0.4 | **2-reviewer slate drafted per PR** | `wave_3_scope.tier_*` entries each list `assignee` + `reviewer` (and a 2nd reviewer for charter compliance — see charter `pull-requests.md` § Two-Reviewer Assignment at Wave Kickoff) |
| 0.5 | **Agent naming pattern** | `{FirstInitial}.{LastName}/{IIII}-{slug}` per CLAUDE.md § Branching Strategy. Verify in execution plan |
| 0.6 | **Spawn-brief ordering** | Each spawn brief lists reviewer-class identity AHEAD of implementer-class identity. Reviewer-first prevents Pattern B inversion (the implementer drafts → reviewer verifies-vs-artifact chain only works if the reviewer's role is established before the implementer starts coding) |

If any check fails for any repo, STOP and resolve before proceeding. The output of this step is a 6×N table (6 checks × N repos in scope) with explicit YES/NO/N-A entries — paste it into the kickoff comment on the meta-issue so the gap-resolution audit trail lives on the issue.

### 1. Create the deployments branch in every wave repo

For **every** repo `R` in `$WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE` (not just the orchestrator repo — main#238 closed in W4), create `deployments/phase-{N}/wave-{M}` from `origin/main`. The skill uses `gh api` directly so it does NOT require a clean local checkout — this is intentional, since the orchestrator session may be running in an unrelated worktree.

**Idempotency contract:** if the branch already exists in `R`, the skill MUST NOT fail. It distinguishes three cases via GitHub's `compare` API:
- `exists-clean` — wave branch SHA == main SHA (just-created or unchanged)
- `exists-ancestor` — wave branch is an ancestor of main (main advanced after kickoff; expected after the kickoff status commit lands)
- `exists-drift` — wave branch and main have diverged (someone pushed a non-main commit onto the wave branch — surface, do NOT overwrite)

**Dry-run mode:** if `WAVE_KICKOFF_DRY_RUN=1` is set in the environment, the skill MUST print the per-repo plan but skip the POST that creates the ref. Reads (lookup of existing ref + main SHA) still execute.

```bash
BRANCH="deployments/phase-{N}/wave-{M}"
declare -A BRANCH_SHA  # repo -> resulting SHA (for status-file update + table)
declare -A BRANCH_STATUS  # repo -> "created" | "exists-clean" | "exists-ancestor" | "exists-drift" | "dry-run-create" | "error:<msg>"

for R in $WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE; do
  MAIN_SHA=$(gh api "repos/noorinalabs/$R/git/refs/heads/main" --jq '.object.sha' 2>/dev/null) || {
    BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="error:cannot-read-main"; continue;
  }

  # Probe existing branch
  EXISTING_SHA=$(gh api "repos/noorinalabs/$R/git/refs/heads/$BRANCH" --jq '.object.sha' 2>/dev/null || true)

  if [ -n "$EXISTING_SHA" ]; then
    BRANCH_SHA[$R]="$EXISTING_SHA"
    if [ "$EXISTING_SHA" = "$MAIN_SHA" ]; then
      BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="exists-clean"
    else
      # Use compare API to distinguish ancestor (main moved forward) from real drift (wave branch diverged)
      STATUS_TYPE=$(gh api "repos/noorinalabs/$R/compare/main...$EXISTING_SHA" --jq '.status' 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
      case "$STATUS_TYPE" in
        behind|identical) BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="exists-ancestor" ;;  # wave branch behind main = ancestor case
        ahead|diverged)   BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="exists-drift" ;;     # real drift
        *)                BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="exists-drift" ;;
      esac
    fi
    continue
  fi

  if [ "${WAVE_KICKOFF_DRY_RUN:-0}" = "1" ]; then
    BRANCH_SHA[$R]="$MAIN_SHA"
    BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="dry-run-create"
    continue
  fi

  # Create the ref. 422 means "ref already exists" — race-safe idempotency.
  CREATE_OUT=$(gh api -X POST "repos/noorinalabs/$R/git/refs" \
    -f "ref=refs/heads/$BRANCH" -f "sha=$MAIN_SHA" 2>&1) && {
    BRANCH_SHA[$R]="$MAIN_SHA"
    BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="created"
  } || {
    if echo "$CREATE_OUT" | grep -q "Reference already exists"; then
      BRANCH_SHA[$R]="$MAIN_SHA"; BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="exists-clean"  # raced; treat as no-op
    else
      BRANCH_STATUS[$R]="error:$(echo "$CREATE_OUT" | head -1 | tr -d '"' | cut -c1-80)"
    fi
  }
done
```

Print a status table (always, in both dry-run and live mode):

```
| Repo                              | Branch SHA  | Status         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| noorinalabs-main                  | 93f3513...  | created        |
| noorinalabs-isnad-graph           | bbf7073...  | exists-clean   |
| noorinalabs-user-service          | 8deb979...  | exists-ancestor|
| noorinalabs-deploy                | 0b3b214...  | exists-drift   |
| noorinalabs-design-system         |  —          | error:cannot-read-main |
```

**Stop-the-line conditions:**
- Any `error:*` — investigate before continuing (likely a missing repo or a permissions gap, not the skill's bug to swallow)
- Any `exists-drift` — a prior session pushed a non-main commit onto this branch. Surface to the user; do NOT overwrite. Decide whether to rebase, fast-forward, or accept.

**Persist results to `cross-repo-status.json`:**

```bash
# Build a JSON object {repo: {sha, status}} and merge under wave_{M}_branches
TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
JSON=$(for R in $WAVE_REPOS_IN_SCOPE; do
  printf '%s\n' "$R ${BRANCH_SHA[$R]:-null} ${BRANCH_STATUS[$R]}"
done | jq -Rn --arg ts "$TS" --arg branch "$BRANCH" '
  [inputs | split(" ")] |
  map({(.[0]): {sha: (.[1] | if . == "null" then null else . end), status: .[2]}}) |
  add | {branch: $branch, created_at: $ts, repos: .}')

if [ "${WAVE_KICKOFF_DRY_RUN:-0}" != "1" ]; then
  jq --argjson b "$JSON" '.wave_{M}_branches = $b' "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json" \
    > "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json.tmp" && mv "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json.tmp" "$REPO_ROOT/cross-repo-status.json"
fi
```

**Verify step 0.1 holds for every repo before moving on** — every entry in the status table must be `created`, `exists-clean`, `exists-ancestor`, or (with explicit user sign-off) `exists-drift`. A missing or errored wave branch in any child repo is a stop-the-line condition.

### 2. Create wave label

Check if label `p{N}-wave-{M}` exists:

```bash
gh label list --search "p{N}-wave-{M}"
```

If missing, create it:

```bash
gh label create "p{N}-wave-{M}" --description "Phase {N} Wave {M}" --color "8B5CF6"
```

### 3. Pre-wave auth/scope audit

Verify the gh token has the scopes needed for this wave's operations. GitHub periodically hardens scope enforcement (e.g., Projects v2 requires the explicit `project` write scope; classic-Projects API deprecation). A missing scope mid-wave consumes orchestrator + user time chasing OAuth flows.

```bash
gh api -i user 2>&1 | grep -i "x-oauth-scopes"
```

Required scopes (baseline for all waves):
- `repo` — issues, PRs, comments, code
- `read:org` — roster / label lookups
- `project` — adding issues/PRs to the board (`gh project item-add`)
- `workflow` — editing `.github/workflows/*` files
- `gist`, `admin:public_key` — retained from prior grants

If any required scope is missing, instruct the user:
```
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s {missing_scope}
```
Wait for confirmation that scopes are updated before proceeding. Do NOT begin wave assignment with known-missing scopes.

**Why:** Phase 2 Wave 8 surfaced the Projects v2 scope gap mid-retro while trying to add PR #122 to the board. Fixing it interactively consumed ~30 minutes. Catching this at wave-kickoff prevents mid-wave interruptions.

### 4. Pre-wave CI triage

Before assigning issues, verify CI health across all repos in the wave scope:

```bash
gh run list --repo noorinalabs/{repo} --branch main --limit 1 --json conclusion
```

For each repo:
- If `conclusion` is `"success"`, mark it green.
- If `conclusion` is `"failure"` or missing, create a GitHub issue in that repo:
  ```bash
  gh issue create --repo noorinalabs/{repo} --title "CI red on main — triage before p{N}-wave-{M}" \
    --label "bug" --label "p{N}-wave-{M}" \
    --body "CI is failing on main. This must be triaged before wave work begins on this repo."
  ```
- Present a summary table to the user:
  | Repo | CI Status | Issue |
  |------|-----------|-------|
  | `noorinalabs-isnad-graph` | pass / **FAIL** | — / #NNN |

Flag repos with known-red CI so engineers are not confused by pre-existing failures.

### 5. Cross-reference wave issues against recent merges

Before posting kickoff comments, check if any wave issues were already resolved:

```bash
gh pr list --repo noorinalabs/{repo} --state merged --limit 20 --json number,title,body
```

For each merged PR:
1. Extract `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, or `Resolves #N` references from the PR body and title.
2. Compare those issue numbers against the wave issue list.
3. If a match is found, flag it to the user:
   ```
   ⚠ Issue #{N} ("{title}") may already be resolved by PR #{M} ("{pr_title}").
   Verify before assigning — remove from wave if confirmed fixed.
   ```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with assignment. Remove any confirmed-resolved issues from the wave list.

### 6. Collect issue list and assignments

Prompt the user for:
- List of issue numbers for this wave
- Assignee for each issue (FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME label)
- Peer review pairings (reviewer for each engineer)

Validate all assignee labels exist before proceeding:

```bash
gh label list --search "FIRSTNAME"
```

Create any missing labels before applying.

### 7. Label all issues

For each issue, apply the wave label and assignee label:

```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} --add-label "p{N}-wave-{M}" --add-label "{FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME}"
```

### 8. Post kickoff comments

Post a kickoff comment on each issue using charter format:

```
Requestor: Fatima.Okonkwo
Requestee: {Assignee.Name}
RequestOrReplied: Request

**Wave {M} Kickoff — Phase {N}**

This issue is assigned to you for p{N}-wave-{M}.
- Peer reviewer: {reviewer name}
- Branch from: `deployments/phase{N}/wave-{M}`
- Branch naming: `{FirstInitial}.{LastName}/{IIII}-{issue-slug}`
- Priority: {hotfix|security|bug|feature} (per charter § Wave Planning & Priority)

Please begin implementation.
```

### 9. Ontology librarian — both bakes required (MANDATORY)

**Two hooks enforce this independently, so both steps are required:**

**(a) Orchestrator bakes librarian output into the spawn prompt** — `enforce_ontology_context.py` scans the Agent tool prompt for the literal heading `## Ontology Context` and **blocks** the spawn if absent.

For each agent in the wave:
1. Identify the repos and code areas they'll modify
2. Run the librarian with a descriptive query:
   ```
   /ontology-librarian {repo} {area being modified}
   ```
3. Include the librarian's output (entities, services, conventions, stale warnings) in the agent's spawn prompt under a `## Ontology Context` section (literal heading — the hook matches on it)

**(b) Instruct the agent to run `/ontology-librarian` themselves as their FIRST action** — Hook 15 (`enforce_librarian_consulted.py`) scans the spawned agent's own transcript independently. Passing baked context from the orchestrator is not enough; Hook 15 still blocks Edit/Write/NotebookEdit until the agent invokes the librarian in their own session.

Spawn prompt pattern that satisfies both:
```
## MANDATORY first action
Run `/ontology-librarian {topic}` **yourself** in this session before any Edit/Write. Hook 15 scans your transcript.

## Ontology Context
(Baked from orchestrator's librarian run. Contents here.)
```

**Why:** In P2W3, running the librarian before spawning agents identified 10 stale issues — saving significant wasted effort. In P2W10 kickoff, the orchestrator forgot the `## Ontology Context` heading on 3 parallel spawns and all 3 were blocked.

### 9a. Delegation pattern — orchestrator spawns, managers request

Per charter `agents.md` § Hub-and-Spoke Orchestration Model + § Single-Leader Constraint:

- **Only the orchestrator (team lead) can call Agent.** Managers and implementers do not have the Agent tool.
- **Single team per session** — one `TeamCreate` per orchestrator session; additional TeamCreates fail with "Already leading team." Use `team_name: "noorinalabs"` for cross-repo waves.
- **Managers request implementer spawns** via `SendMessage` to the team lead with full context (name, roster file, issue, branch, reviewers, Contract ownership if applicable).
- **Team lead spawns each implementer** following step 9 above (both bakes).

When composing spawn prompts for implementers, pull the manager's specified reviewer pairings, branch names, and Contract expectations into the prompt so the implementer starts with full context.

### 10. Output execution plan

Generate and display a structured execution plan with:
- **Priority ordering:** hotfixes first, then security fixes, then bugs, then features (per charter § Wave Planning & Priority)
- **Issue table:** number, title, assignee, reviewer, priority tier
- **Dependencies:** any cross-PR dependencies identified
- **Estimated parallelism:** which issues can run concurrently

### 11. Report

Present the full plan to the user. Do NOT begin implementation until the user approves.

## What remains manual

- User must approve the execution plan before implementation starts
- User decides which issues to include in the wave
- Cross-team dependency resolution still requires lead coordination
