"""PreToolUse hook: Require TWO PR review comments before merge.

Blocks `gh pr merge` unless the PR has at least two reviews from distinct
non-authors, using either formal GitHub reviews or charter-format
comment-based reviews from different team members. Honors the
Single-Reviewer Exception for wave-bootstrap PRs reviewed by a charter-
enforcer role.

Input Language:
  Fires on:      PreToolUse Bash
  Matches:       gh pr merge [{N}] [--repo {OWNER/REPO}] [--squash|--merge|--rebase]
                             [--admin] [--auto]   — including when chained via
                             && / || / | / ; after env-var assignments.
  Does NOT match: gh pr list, gh pr view, gh pr checks, gh pr create,
                  git merge, git pull.
  Flag pass-through:
    --repo   → forwarded to `gh pr view` and comment fetch so the hook checks
               the PR in the repo the user named, not the cwd-resolved repo.
    --admin  → short-circuits (emergency override — allows merge).

Charter-format review comments (canonical per `pull-requests.md` § Comment-Based Reviews,
resolves #233):

  Requestor: <comment author>     # always the team member POSTING the comment
  Requestee: <comment target>     # always the team member ADDRESSED by the comment
  RequestOrReplied: <Request|Reply|Approved|ChangesRequested>
  TechDebt: none | #15, #16, ...

  Direction by RequestOrReplied:
    - Request          — Requestor=PR author,  Requestee=reviewer (NOT a verdict)
    - Reply / Replied  — Requestor=replier,    Requestee=person-being-replied-to (NOT a verdict)
    - Approved         — Requestor=reviewer,   Requestee=PR author (verdict)
    - ChangesRequested — Requestor=reviewer,   Requestee=PR author (verdict)

  The reviewer for a verdict comment is the comment AUTHOR — i.e. the
  Requestor. The prior hook counted distinct Requestee values across
  Approved/ChangesRequested comments, which on verdicts is always the PR
  author and so collapsed to a single value (resolves #244).

Reviewer counting rule (resolves #244):
  - Verdict comments (Approved / ChangesRequested) → Requestor is the reviewer
  - Request / Reply comments → not reviews; do not contribute to reviewer count
  - Two-reviewer rule satisfied when there are TWO DISTINCT REVIEWER NAMES across
    Approved comments, neither of which is the PR author.

Reviewer dedup key:
  The reviewer set is keyed on the FULL reviewer name (lowercased), not on
  the lastname. Two distinct reviewers with the same lastname (e.g.,
  "Lucas Ferreira" and "Santiago Ferreira") are counted as TWO reviewers
  toward the two-peer-review requirement (issue #164).
  The author-equality check uses lastname because branches are named
  `{Initial}.{Lastname}/...` and we only have the author's lastname to
  compare against.

Single-Reviewer Exception (resolves #228):
  When the PR is labeled `wave-bootstrap` AND there is exactly ONE distinct
  reviewer who is a charter-enforcer role in the local roster, the hook
  permits merge with one Approved comment instead of two. Charter
  `pull-requests.md` § Single-Reviewer Exception (Wave-Bootstrap Only)
  defines the policy; this is its hook-side enforcement.

  Charter-enforcer roles are derived from the local repo's
  `.claude/team/roster/` filenames matching the prefix allowlist:
    standards_lead_*    (parent: Aino)
    program_director_*  (parent: Nadia)
    manager_*           (children: e.g. Maeve, Dilara, Bereket)
    project_lead_*      (children: e.g. Marcia)
    tech_lead_*         (children: e.g. Anya)
  Each file's `**Name:** <Full Name>` line is parsed for the canonical name.

Exit codes:
  0 — allow (not a merge command, two reviews, or single-reviewer exception)
  2 — block (fewer than two reviews and exception does not apply, or a
      verdict is missing TechDebt)
